                is a requirement of the revised EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2) for payment service providers in 
                the European Economic Area. The requirement ensures that electronic payments are made with multifactorial 
                authentication and personally by the account holder in order to increase the security of electronic payments. 
                Starting September 14, 2019, banks in 31 countries of the European Economic Area are required to verify 
                the identity of a person before processing a payment. Our bank is one of them, in connection with the 
                mandatory introduction of this standard. Such verification requires multifactorial authentication to ensure 
                the security of online purchases and transfers from your personal account. 
                How does Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) work? 
                Our bank determines when to apply multi-level authentication based on transaction amount, purchase or 
                other factors. 
                Why do banks and financial institutions across Europe implement this requirement? 
                Our bank requires multifactorial authentication, according to the law, to prevent fraud and unauthorized 
                access to your account so that only you can make purchases using your payment credentials. 
                What purchases or actions are required by the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) and Strong Customer 
                Authentication (SCA)? 
                Any purchase on the Internet or on an e-commerce site using American Express, Mastercard, Visa, MIR 
                cards may require multi-factor authentication to make a payment. 
                Request additional authentication when making a payment, shopping online, or other financial transactions. 
                This is often necessary if the client who made the outgoing transaction is not a resident of the country 
                in which the bank is located. Strict Client Authentication (SCA) requires you to complete additional 
                client verification to authenticate your identity and be able to issue a transaction. 
                You need to make an incoming money transfer in the amount equal to your identification number, from a 
                bank card of a third-party bank, of which you are the holder. 
                This replenishment must be made by the number of your digital card of our bank. The minimum amount to 
                top up your digital card is 100 RUB. 
                Top-up is not a paid process and is not a payment, it will be credited to your personal account and will 
                be available for withdrawal after this verification. 
                Otherwise, your outgoing transaction will be rejected and our bank will not be able to process it due to 
                non-compliance with SCA requirements. Multi-factor authentication is only requested once until confirmed. 
                To pass it, you need to contact the bank\'s online administrator.',

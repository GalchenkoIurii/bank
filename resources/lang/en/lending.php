            You have verified your identity online or during a personal visit to a bank 
            branch.
            How are funds credited?
            The loan is credited to your account, in our bank and access to withdrawal to 
            any cards in the world,
            or through the bank\'s cash desk
            The loan agreement in our bank, you can download to any electronic medium, in 
            your personal account
            after the funds are credited to you.
            Why do banks refuse a loan?
            The bank decides to approve a loan application using a special mathematical 
            model that takes into
            account very large amounts of data. That is why it is sometimes difficult to 
            name a specific reason
            for refusing a loan. But if there is such an opportunity, the bank will 
            indicate why it did not
            approve the loan in the notification of the refusal. If our bank denied you 
            a loan, try filling out
            a new application by changing the application parameters. This will increase 
            the chance of approval
            for a lower amount than you requested the first time.',

В случае нарушения срока погашения кредита и уплаты процентов Банк взыскивает штраф в размере % от непогашенной суммы задолженности кредита за каждый день просрочки. 5. Ссудозаемщик обязуется исполнять следующие обязательства: - предоставить в Банк для оформления и выдачи кредита следующие документы, оформленные в соответствии с действующей банковской практикой: - устав, баланс, свидетельство о государственной регистрации; - срочное обязательство по сумме и сроку погашения кредита; - карточку с образцами подписей и оттиском печати, заверенную в установленном порядке; - использовать полученную ссуду на предусмотренные договором цели, своевременно погасить полученный кредит вместе с начисленными процентами, предоставить Банку право контролировать целевое использование кредита. При нецелевом использовании кредита, а также невыполнении других условий договора Банк вправе предъявить ссуду к досрочному взысканию. 6. Банк, руководствуясь предметом договора, обязуется ежемесячно начислять проценты за пользование кредитом и взыскивать их с расчетного счета Ссудозаемщика инкассовыми поручениями. 7. Разногласия, возникающие в процессе выполнения условий данного договора, предварительно рассматриваются сторонами в целях выработки взаимоприемлемого решения с оформлением двустороннего протокола рассмотрения. При невозможности урегулирования споров и разногласий путем двустороннего соглашения они передаются на рассмотрение в органы арбитражного суда или суда. 8. Ни одна из сторон не имеет права передавать свои права и обязанности по настоящему договору третьим лицам без письменного на то согласия другой стороны. 9. Настоящий договор составлен в трех экземплярах: первый и третий хранятся в Банке, второй - у Ссудозаемщика. Настоящий договор вступает в силу с момента его подписания и действует до прекращения отношений по нему. Все приложения к договору являются его неотъемлемой частью. Всякие изменения и дополнения к настоящему договору будут действительны лишь при условии, если они совершены в письменной форме и подписаны обеими сторонами. Действие настоящего договора может быть прекращено односторонне и по предварительному извещению Ссудозаемщика при условии, что он полностью вернет ссуду вместе с процентами по ней. Сторона, для которой создалась невозможность исполнения обязательств по договору, обязана (не позднее дней с момента их наступления) в письменной форме уведомить другую сторону для принятия соответствующего решения. 9.
